# Microprocessors Simulations
Simulations developed during the [microprocessors](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/course/microprocessors/?lang=en) class [@cse.uoi.gr](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/).

## Contents
* sim_1: Switching activity calculation for logic gates/logic circuits using Monte Carlo simulation and signal probabilities.

* sim_2: Stress test input generation for logic circuits using random workloads and a genetic algorithm. Also contains a loader that can load larger circuits from a model file.

* micro-cpu: Microprocessor, designed in Verilog, which was studied, tested and modified using ModelSim Altera 10.1 (Quartus II 13.0sp1) during the course.
